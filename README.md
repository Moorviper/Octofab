# Octofab
A tool to turn awesome 3D printer/laser cutter/CNC milling web applications into standalone independent applications for use with Smoothieboard's on-board web interface, or on-line

The basic process is :Â 
* Grab the web interface off the internet or a local copy
* Transform it so everything ( including templates, javascript, CSS ) is included into a single HTML file
* Add a bit of javascript at the end that makes it compatible with Smoothie

# Current targets

* Octocut
* Laserweb
* DC42's online least squares calibration
